# Loto Keno!

*A delightful little absurdity from the CGA dimension.*

## About

**Loto Keno!** is a simple, zen-like game of chance. You place your bet, trust the RNG, and enjoy the results — or the chaos. There's no grand goal (yet), no deep lore (thankfully), and no samurai (despite the odds). Just numbers, colors, random quotes, and a whole lot of unexpected charm.

This project began life as a nebulous idea all the way back in 2005: something between a coin toss simulator and a soundboard joke. With no real design, it lived only as a fragment — echoing "bud-bud-bud!" and "aa-ooo-ooo!" in the memory of its creator, like a fever dream built from CRT afterglow and forgotten DOS sounds.

In March 2025, that idea finally took shape. What started as a half-remembered joke bloomed into a real, fully playable SDL2-based retro-minimalist experience, thanks to the encouragement of one slightly too curious AI.

And so, the game emerged: 
- Featuring ridiculous quotes (with more to come!).
- Sporting hot-swappable multilingual support (EN/RU).
- Embracing authentic low-res visuals (CGA-style, with dreams of EGA/VGA).
- Requiring zero skill, but offering maximum attitude.

## How to Play

Just... play. It doesn't explain itself. It barely makes sense. That's part of the fun.

Try not to lose all your points. Or do. Who's judging?
