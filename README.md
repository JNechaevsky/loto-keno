# Loto Keno!
«Loto Keno!» is a minimalist betting game inspired by retro CGA visuals, where players start with a set amount of points and wager on whether a randomly generated number will be even ("Будь-будь-будь!") or odd ("А-ооо!"). A special "HNA!" event appears randomly, doubling the potential winnings or losses, adding an extra layer of unpredictability. The game continues indefinitely until the player runs out of points, embracing both the simplicity and charm of classic arcade-style mechanics.
