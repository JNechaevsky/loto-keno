# Loto Keno!

*A delightful little absurdity from the CGA dimension.*

## About

Somewhere around 2005, the idea for a simple "even-or-odd" guessing game was born. It wasn't really a concept or a design — more of an expressive outburst based on funny sounds like "bood-bood-bood!" and "aa-ooo-ooo!". Originally, it was imagined that shouting "hna!" (ヘンナ！) would summon an icon of a stern samurai… but in the current version, he’s mysteriously absent. As for how bets, samurais, and CGA palettes are all connected — I honestly have no idea. It just felt funny. Sometimes, creation is pure chaos. And absurdity.

It wasn’t until March 2025 that this little joke began to take on flesh and logic, cross-platform compatibility, an actual idea — and even a working implementation. We threw in a whole bunch of quotes for win and loss events, to crank up the absurd humor factor.

And so, the game emerged: 
- Featuring ridiculous quotes.
- Sporting hot-swappable multilingual support (EN/DE/RU).
- Embracing authentic CGA low-res visuals.
- Requiring zero skill, but offering maximum attitude.

So, what's the goal of the game?

We don’t know. But we’ll figure it out! At the very least, try not to lose all your points. Beyond that — it’s just a Zen mode to test your luck against the almighty Random Number Generator.

## How to Play

Just... play. It doesn't explain itself. It barely makes sense. That's part of the fun.

Try not to lose all your points. Or do. Who's judging?

**Controls:**

* <kbd>←</kbd> and <kbd>→</kbd> — switch between "Blub-blub-blub!" and "A-OOOH-OOH-Oh!"
* <kbd>↑</kbd> and <kbd>↓</kbd> — increase or decrease your bet
* <kbd>ENTER</kbd> — confirm your selection
* You can also use the mouse to choose a side and adjust the bet with the scroll wheel.
